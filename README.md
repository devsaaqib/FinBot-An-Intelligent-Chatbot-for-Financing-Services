# FinBot-An-Intelligent-Chatbot-for-Financing-Services
Finbot is an intelligent chatbot developed by Saaqib to provide personalized financial services. It helps users manage their wallet, track expenses, view scheduled payments, and get spending advice. Built using NLU and LSTM models, Finbot offers a smart, responsive, and user-friendly web interface.


**STATEMENT**

We aim to build a simple, intelligent chatbot named Finbot, which will provide personalized financial services to a user based on wallet details, account information, and previous and scheduled expenditures. Finbot will take the form of a responsive web application, where the user can post queries and receive the most suitable responses.

**MOTIVATION**

In today’s digital world, managing finances is a growing challenge for both individuals and organizations. While certain scheduled expenses are inevitable, impulsive spending often disrupts financial balance.
